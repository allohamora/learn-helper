# Server Task Generation

This document describes the task types generated by the server (using AI) for the Learn Helper learning system. Each task type is generated dynamically based on the target vocabulary word or phrase.

## Ranking

Each task type is scored from 1 to 10 on seven parameters. Maximum total score is 70.

- **Retrieval Effort** - How hard the brain works to pull the word from memory. Passive reading = low effort. Producing word from scratch = high effort. Higher effort leads to stronger memory traces.
- **Cognitive Load** - Mental strain during the task. Too much (multiple inputs at once) overwhelms working memory. Too little (just staring) causes no learning. Optimal load = focused challenge.
- **Association Building** - Does the task connect the word to other knowledge? Isolated word-definition pairs = weak. Words linked to images, synonyms, contexts, personal experiences = strong network.
- **Feedback Quality** - What happens after an answer? No feedback = learner stays confused. "Correct/wrong" = minimal help. Showing correct answer + explanation + examples = strong learning signal.
- **Spacing Compatibility** - Can the task be repeated over time with growing intervals? One-time tasks fade. Tasks that return days/weeks later at optimal intervals = long-term retention.
- **Engagement Factor** - Does the learner want to continue? Boring repetition = dropout. Progress tracking, variety, achievable challenges = sustained motivation.
- **Transfer Potential** - Will the learner recognize this word when reading a real book or article? Drill-only tasks = weak transfer. Varied real-world contexts = strong transfer.

## Task Types

### 1. Translate English Sentence

**Description**: Students arrange shuffled Ukrainian words to form the correct translation of an English sentence containing the target word/phrase.

**Schema**:

```typescript
{
  id: number;
  sentence: string; // English sentence with target word (3-15 words)
  translation: string; // Ukrainian translation (3-15 words, single spaces, punctuation attached, first word capitalized only)
}
```

**Notes**:

- **Level-appropriate grammar**: Match sentence complexity to the word's CEFR level - for B1, use conditionals; for B2, use mixed conditionals or complex tenses; for A2, keep it simple
- **Natural language**: English sentences and Ukrainian translations must sound fluent and authentic
- **Punctuation variety**: Use statements (.), questions (?), and exclamations (!) based on sentence type
- **Translation formatting**: 3-15 words, single-space separated, punctuation attached to words, first word capitalized only
- **UI normalization**: Trailing periods are stripped from sentences/translations before shuffling to avoid model-added periods
- **Unambiguous word order**: The Ukrainian translation must have one clear valid order when shuffled
- **All words separate**: Pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, and particles must be separate tokens
- **Adjective-noun agreement**: Ensure correct gender, number, and case agreement in Ukrainian
- **Phrase integration**: When the target is a phrase, include it naturally within the English sentence

**Examples**:

- **Simple sentence**:
  - Word: "beautiful"
  - Sentence: "The garden is beautiful"
  - Translation: "Сад гарний"
  - Scrambled (in UI): ["Сад", "гарний"]

- **Phrase in context**:
  - Word: "take care of"
  - Sentence: "I take care of my plants"
  - Translation: "Я доглядаю за своїми рослинами"
  - Scrambled: ["доглядаю", "своїми", "Я", "за", "рослинами"]

- **Question sentence**:
  - Word: "ready"
  - Sentence: "Are you ready?"
  - Translation: "Ти готовий?"
  - Scrambled: ["готовий?", "Ти"]

| --------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Retrieval Effort      | 6     | Must reconstruct target sentence from shuffled words  |
| Cognitive Load        | 7     | Requires sentence parsing and word-order reasoning    |
| Association Building  | 7     | Builds strong cross-language sentence associations    |
| Feedback Quality      | 6     | Clear right/wrong order; no explanation of grammar    |
| Spacing Compatibility | 6     | Effective for repetition; needs variety to stay fresh |
| Engagement Factor     | 7     | Puzzle-like; satisfying when correct                  |
| Transfer Potential    | 8     | Strong practice for syntax and translation flow       |
| **Overall**           | 47/70 |                                                       |

### 2. Translate Ukrainian Sentence

**Description**: Students arrange shuffled English words to form the correct translation of a Ukrainian sentence containing the translated target word/phrase.

**Schema**:

```typescript
{
  id: number;
  sentence: string; // Ukrainian sentence with translated target word (3-15 words)
  translation: string; // English translation (3-15 words, single spaces, punctuation attached, first word capitalized only)
}
```

**Notes**:

- **Level-appropriate grammar**: Match sentence complexity to the word's CEFR level - for B1, use conditionals; for B2, use mixed conditionals or complex tenses; for A2, keep it simple
- **Natural language**: Ukrainian sentences and English translations must sound fluent and authentic
- **Punctuation variety**: Use statements (.), questions (?), and exclamations (!) based on sentence type
- **English completeness**: Include ALL articles (a/an/the), ALL prepositions (to/at/in/for), ALL auxiliary verbs, and correct verb forms
- **Translation formatting**: 3-15 words, single-space separated, punctuation attached to words, first word capitalized only
- **UI normalization**: Trailing periods are stripped from sentences/translations before shuffling to avoid model-added periods
- **Unambiguous word order**: The English translation must have one clear valid order when shuffled
- **All words separate**: Articles, prepositions, conjunctions, and auxiliaries must be separate tokens
- **Phrase integration**: When the target is a phrase, include it naturally within the Ukrainian sentence

**Examples**:

- **Simple sentence**:
  - Word: "beautiful"
  - Sentence: "Сад гарний"
  - Translation: "The garden is beautiful"
  - Scrambled (in UI): ["garden", "The", "is", "beautiful"]

- **Articles and prepositions**:
  - Word: "at"
  - Sentence: "Вона в магазині"
  - Translation: "She is at the store"
  - Scrambled: ["the", "at", "She", "is", "store"]

  - Sentence: "Вони збираються подорожувати завтра"
